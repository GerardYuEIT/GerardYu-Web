# Gerard's Modular Web Portfolio

Welcome to my personal web portfolio â€” a responsive, modular showcase of my work as a Bachelor of Computing Systems student at EIT. This site demonstrates my skills in frontend development, dynamic UI/UX, and clean code architecture using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 5.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design using Bootstrap 5 grid and utility classes.
- **Modular Components**: Each demo (e.g., product grid, shopping cart, dropdowns, XML/RSS viewers) is isolated for maintainability.
- **Dynamic XML Viewer**: Loads and displays XML syntax rules with live filtering.
- **RSS Feed Reader**: Fetches and parses live news feeds using CORS proxy and XMLHttpRequest.
- **Interactive UI**: Collapsible panels, embedded Google Forms, and search functionality.
- **Privacy Policy**: Linked via [TermsFeed](https://www.termsfeed.com/live/7303cbca-f9fa-482d-a5b4-ab729cd0ef33).

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
